      <p>
        My name is Ramses, I was born and raised in Colombia. Music production
        software was what initially peaked my curiosity for software
        engineering. I recently graduated from Lambda School which is a 9 month
        technical training program specializing in web dev and computer science
        fundamentals, with a focus on group project work that mimics the product
        development lifecycle.
